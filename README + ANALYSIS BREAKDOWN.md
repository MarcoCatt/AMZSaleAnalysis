What is the Spreadsheet about: 
This dataset provides an in-depth look at the profitability of e-commerce sales. 
The columns contain data such as SKU codes, design numbers, stock levels, product categories, sizes and colors.

Tools used: 
XLOOKUP, SUMIF, Conditional Formatting, Pivots, Graphs

Actions taken: 

-Grouped together the most important columns, added stock, sales and Rev to the same sheet

-Divided the Units Sold by Category/Size/Color and % of Total to understand Which Category,size, color is selling the best

-Based on these tables the user of the file can always keep an eye on the stock for the bestsellers in each category

-Stock column has conditional formatting on units available, if they are red its low on stock, yellow means the stock is close to low and green means we are stocked 

-In the following sheets there are pivots to manage data and insights more easily and also graphs to interpret the data to stakeholders and other users more easily 

Final Thoughts and Call to action:

Based on this analysis, the stock is maintained very poorly as many bestsellers and sizes of bestsellers are running out of stock, while we are stocked on products which are not selling. Poor inventory management. 
The business should focus more on the mainstream Categories, reduce portfolio and reduce color variety as some are not even 1% of the business. 
The customers made clear in the sales which products are the most effective and profitable for the business.
